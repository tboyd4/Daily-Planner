# Daily Event/Task Planner
    * This Web Application will allow a user to create and save events for their day
## Instructions
    * The user, upon loading the application, will see a daily schedule, with hourly time slots ranging 9am to 5pm
    * The user will know be able to add events for the present hour, and future hours, but will lock past hours
    * The user will type events into a time slot, and press the save button for that time slot
## The Result
    * The user will have their schedule laid out, and will be able to discern what events they have completed, and which still need to take place
    * The user will see their events even after closing the browser or refreshing
    * The user now has a dynamic schedule that changes as the time changes
